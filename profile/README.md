## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Welcome to eniac-x-lab's developer community. We're so glad you stopped by!

our team focusing on common layer3 app chain technology solutions. Our vision is to create a layer3 app chain network where thousands of chains are interconnected and everything can be blockchained. We will launch a layer3 app chain network that is compatible with all layer2 (such as Bitcoin layer2 , Ethereum Layer2)'s cross-chain interoperability protocol and staking protocol, and then gradually launch the layer privacy social + game protocol app chain, layer3 hosting protocol app chain and layer3 exchange protocol app chain, and finally achieve the interconnection of thousands of chains, and everything can be blockchain in layer3 blockchain network.
