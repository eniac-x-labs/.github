## About Dapplink

Dapplink Layer3 Solutions is dedicated to building a layer3 app chain network aimed at seamlessly interconnecting thousands of chains and enabling comprehensive blockchain integration. Our aspiration is to establish a network that supports cross-chain interoperability and staking protocols compatible with all layer2 platforms, including both Ethereum and Bitcoin Layer2. Our initial launch will feature a cross-chain interoperability protocol that supports Optimism mainnet, Polygon zkEVM and Scroll. Subsequently, we plan to expand support to encompass Ethereum and all mainstream layer2 projects, with future plans to facilitate cross-chain operations for BTC and its layer2 projects. 

We are committed to progressively introducing protocols to support the development of privacy, social, gaming, custody, and exchange modules within our layer3 blockchain network, ultimately paving the way for the interconnectedness of myriad chains and comprehensive blockchain utilization.
